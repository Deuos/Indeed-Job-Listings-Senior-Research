https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f9067c53495582d4,indeed,Chief Information Officer,Baruch College,"New York, NY, USA",fulltime,########,yearly,200000,230000,USD,FALSE,0,,,"About Baruch College Baruch College has a long and storied history of advocating and pioneering for change in public higher education. Regularly ranked among the region’s and nation’s top college’s by U.S. News & World Report, Forbes, Princeton Review, and others, Baruch is within easy reach of Wall Street, Midtown, and the global headquarters of major companies and non-profit and cultural organizations, giving students unparalleled internship, career, and networking opportunities. The College’s more than 19,500 students, who speak more than 110 languages and trace their heritage to more than 168 countries, have been repeatedly named one of the most ethnically diverse student populations in the United States. Over the past decade, the College has experienced an era of historic growth in its facilities, degree offerings, global reach, and student support services. It has earned praise in the news media for providing excellent academics at an affordable price. In 2020, Baruch College welcomed S. David Wu, PhD, as its eight president and the first Asian American to lead a CUNY college. Dr. Wu joined Baruch at an auspicious time as the College develops new and responsive models for teaching, research, student services, and campus safety in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his words, “The vision for Baruch is audacious and sets it apart from the norms in higher education. It demands academic standards and rigor comparable to any top U.S. institution while providing affordable access to students who are largely underrepresented in the system of higher learning. This distinction echoes a central theme in my thinking for Baruch’s future: in epitomizing both academic excellence and social mobility, Baruch is poised to lead in the shifting landscape of higher education. The impact of Baruch is profound, both as a private good-one that advances our students’ personal and career success-and a public good, creating much needed social change, innovation, and economic prosperity for our city, and our world. Drawing on this legacy, we must use the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic to put Baruch on a path to transformation that allows us to deliver our mission with more fluidity and ever-better quality. At the same time, we must help hard hit communities in New York City to recover from Covid.” -President David Wu As he leads Baruch into a new era, Dr. Wu’s aim is to challenge higher education isomorphism—the gravitational pull toward status quo and stagnation, rather than change and innovation—and expand Baruch’s national reach. The College already offers a rare amalgam of academic achievement and upward mobility for diverse students from all echelons of society. With national rankings and accolades affirming what is now a distinctive niche, Baruch could emerge as a new model for higher education: Institutions that insist on academic excellence at the highest level while concurrently expanding their base to support historically under-served students in such a rigorous intellectual environment. To that end, Baruch recently completed a major strategic plan for 2023-2028, Baruch 2028: Unstoppable, which outlines four priority areas: (1) Maximize Students’ Potential to Succeed; (2) Promote Excellence in Research and Impactful Teaching; (3) Strengthen Our Collaborative and Engaged Community; and (4) Optimize Operations and Infrastructure.

Building on the success of the Moore-Sloan Fellows program, CDS has created a Faculty Fellow program to continue to develop outstanding researchers in Data Science. Alumni of the distinguished Moore-Sloan Fellowship program have secured top-level academic positions or industry jobs. For instance, our former Fellows obtained faculty positions here at NYU, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins, the University of Michigan, and the University of Amsterdam, to list just the most recent ones. Given the prestigious nature of the position, we offer a generous compensation package which may include NYU faculty housing as well as funds to support research and travel. The Center for Data Science (CDS) is the focal point for New York University’s university-wide efforts in Data Science. The Center was established in 2013 to advance NYU’s goal of creating a world-leading Data Science training and research facility, and arming researchers and professionals with the tools to harness the power of Big Data. Today, CDS counts 20 jointly appointed interdisciplinary faculty housed on three floors of our modern 60 5th Avenue building, one of New York City’s historic properties. It is home to a top-ranked MS in Data Science program, one of the first PhD programs in Data Science, and a new undergraduate program in Data Science, as well as a lively Fellow and Postdoctoral program. It has over 60 associate and affiliate faculty from 25 departments in 9 schools and units. With cross-disciplinary research and innovative educational programs, CDS is shaping the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning. The CDS Faculty Fellow will be expected to work at the boundaries between the data-science methods and domain sciences. They are also encouraged to develop collaborations with faculty at CDS and NYU. They will lead original research projects of their choosing with impact in one or more scientific domains and in one or more methodological domains (computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics). We seek outstanding interdisciplinary researchers with expertise in the methods of data science possibly with application in physical, life, or social science. The program recognizes that rapid advances in our ability to acquire and generate data are transforming all fields of discovery from data-poor to data-rich. A significant bottleneck to discovery is our ability to perform inference over heterogeneous, noisy, and often massive datasets. Successful candidates will bring a research agenda that can take advantage of the unique intellectual opportunities afforded by NYU, and will have experience in working with researchers across different fields. This is a full-time, non-tenure position, with a light teaching load of one (1) CDS course per year as the primary instructor. You will also be expected to participate in service activities of the Center for Data Science (such as helping review admissions applications, committee work, etc.). Appointments will be for two years. Fellows will be offered a competitive salary and benefits, with funds to support research and travel. A start date of September 1, 2024 is planned. In compliance with NYC’s Pay Transparency Act, the annual base salary range for this position is $85,000 - $95,000. Qualifications Applicants must possess a doctorate degree prior to the beginning of the position. Application Instructions Please submit your curriculum vitae, a list of publications, and a brief statement of research interests (no longer than 4 pages) via our Interfolio application page. The statement of research interests should mention the names of one or more faculty members associated with the NYU Center for Data Science who would have substantial intellectual overlap with the applicant’s interests and likely program of research.

We strongly encourage individuals from underrepresented and/or marginalized identities to apply. In support of a major initiative at Cornell Tech in New York City, the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute seeks to fill a tenured faculty position at the full professor level in the emerging area of urban technology. The position-holder will be nominated for an endowed chair. Cornell Tech is a unique engineering and applied science campus that develops leaders and technologies for the digital age, through research, technology commercialization, and graduate-level education at the professional master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral levels. The Jacobs Institute is a major component of Cornell Tech whose mission is to push the envelope of academia and to transform industries where technology’s impact is most positively felt. Jacobs faculty members combine world-class research and teaching with transdisciplinary thinking. Our innovative new thrust in urban tech is embodied in a growing, multifaceted Urban Tech Hub, which includes a master’s degree program, research initiatives, external partnerships, events, startups, and thought leadership on critical issues facing the cities of today and tomorrow. The Hub will emphasize applications through which technology can make cities stronger, healthier, fairer, and more resilient. These are likely to include, among others, urban mobility, intelligence in urban infrastructure and the built environment, energy and other resource distribution, public health in cities, sustainability, and technology-supported governance and community participation. Cornell Tech’s core technical disciplines of computer science, information science, electrical and computer engineering, and operations research and information engineering will provide the foundation for world-class research and impact in these application domains. For this position, we seek candidates with demonstrated cross-disciplinary success in translating research results into real-world impact in both a core technical area and one or more domains related to urban systems. Our ideal candidate will come from computer science, information science, electrical and computer engineering, or operations research and information engineering, with a proven track record of bridging to more specifically urban systems-related disciplines such as urban planning, architecture, civil engineering, and urban policy; or from an urban-related field, bringing a strong digital foundation (i.e., in computer science, operations research, etc.) with a record of reflecting that foundation in one of the application areas of concern. Our new faculty member will work closely with the leader of the non-academic part of our Urban Tech Hub to develop a world-leading presence in an area of vital importance to cities around the world, and will serve as academic leadership for hub-related activities, our innovative Master of Science program, and significant research initiatives. The new faculty member’s departmental affiliation will depend on their disciplinary background. Candidates must hold a Ph.D., have demonstrated an ability to conduct outstanding research at the level of a tenured full professor at Cornell University, and also have a strong commitment to engagement outside of academia in ways that foster significant commercial or societal impact, as aligned with the mission of the Cornell Tech campus. Successful candidates are expected to pursue an active research program, to teach master’s and Ph.D.-level graduate courses, and to supervise graduate students. Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae and brief statements of research and teaching interests and contributions to diversity, identify two top publications to which they have made significant contributions, and request that at least four references on their behalf be submitted through https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/17406. A distinguishing characteristic of research at Cornell Tech, in addition to world-class academic work, is that it engages deeply with external communities, organizations, K-12 education, and industry to address real-world problems and contexts that amplify the direct commercial and societal impact of our research. Accordingly, within a clearly identified “external engagement” section of the research statement, the candidate should address prior accomplishments and future plans related to this kind of direct commercial and/or societal impact of their research. Cornell Tech particularly values diversity and inclusion. Applicants are asked to submit a Statement of Contribution to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to describe their potential contributions in this area. See http://facultydevelopment.cornell.edu/information-for-faculty-candidates/ for the university’s commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity, including suggestions for what we are looking for in such statements.
